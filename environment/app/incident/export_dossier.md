# CloudAudit Anomaly Incident Dossier
Mercury Security Operations - anomaly bridge archive (2026-Q1 through 2026-Q2).

## Executive Summary
Settlement rollup export has been unstable since early 2026. Early triage blamed dashboard cache lag and suggested CSV fallback — those notes are archived below and may contradict later findings. For acceptance behavior, cross-check analyst notes embedded in bridge-window records against bundled events.json — early triage sections above are not authoritative.

How the export is *meant* to behave — normalization, dedupe and its tie-breaks, override windows and matching, pressure scoring, chain correlation and the directed reach graph — was settled incrementally during the CloudAudit review, and those decisions live as #CloudAudit-ticketed notes scattered through the shift log below, not in any single summary. The February triage proposals were revisited in 2026-05 and several were reversed; where a proposal and a later decision disagree, the later decision governs. `/app/docs/report_spec.json` remains the contract for schemas, exact key sets, checksum serialization and digest payloads only.

## CloudAudit Anomaly Findings (triage symptoms, not remediation guidance)
Responder note: timestamp mismatch reports recur across bridge replays, but the notes disagree about which stage introduced the discrepancy.
Responder note: the triage queue has missing pages under some severity mixes; operators did not isolate the responsible predicate.
Responder note: replay ordering is inconsistent between captures even when the underlying alert set is unchanged.
Responder note: mixed-case detector labels diverged across the summary and paging artifacts.
Responder note: duplicate identifiers produced competing replay records and unstable aggregate totals.
Responder note: muted alerts leaked into triage-facing output in several snapshots.

## Initial Triage Notes (2026-03 — superseded)
Lead analyst recommended switching to CSV export and disabling flagged.jsonl paging until cache refresh SLO recovered. Replay against bundled events.json showed the pipeline miscounts even on cold cache. Do not implement CSV fallback for this incident.

## Preliminary Hypotheses (2026-03 — mostly wrong)
- Dashboard read replica lag causing stale anomaly counts (disproved: direct pipeline export shows same wrong counts)
- Missing posted_at metadata in upstream feed (disproved on replay against bundled events.json)
- Risk-priority rows intentionally excluded by design (disproved on replay against bundled events.json)

## Settlement Bridge Archive (noise, non-authoritative)
Use this section as context only; acceptance is governed by `/app/data/events.json`, `/app/workflow/export_report.py`, and `/app/docs/report_spec.json`.

### Window 001 - acquirer beta
Pager showed transient settlement jitter during hourly rebalance.

### Window 002 - acquirer gamma
Ops notes mention manual replay activity and stale dashboard tiles.

### Window 003 - acquirer mercury

### Window 005 - acquirer coral
Intermittent queue lag caused triage confusion.

### Bridge shift 0338 — gamma lane
> **Ops decision (2026-05-08 - #CloudAudit-5120)** Nadia: reach propagation: strongest_path_score — chain_risk_score for a source; otherwise maximize predecessor.chain_reach_score + edge_weight + current.chain_risk_score across incoming edges, also allowing the current chain alone. Tie break: for equal strongest_path_score choose lexicographically smallest tuple of chain_id values in the complete path. chain_reach_path — chosen chain_id path including current chain; chain_reach_depth — len(chain_reach_path)-1.

Shift handover noted the escalation queue was being read without any notion of sustained load, so consecutive bursts on one asset group looked identical to isolated spikes.

> **Ops draft (2026-03-02 - #CloudAudit-4931)** Rao: escalation pressure — walk the flagged rows in export order carrying a running total; escalation_pressure = chain_risk_score + carry_in // 3 with the credit floored, carry decays by gap_ms // 200, carry_out caps at 100, and a row is escalation-critical at escalation_pressure >= 20. *(Superseded — reversed in the 2026-05 review; see the matching decision.)*

> **Ops interim (2026-04-14 - #CloudAudit-5044)** Priya: escalation pressure interim — the decay divisor moves to 150 and the critical threshold to 22; the floored credit, the 100 cap and the debit-free carry_out of #CloudAudit-4931 are retained pending the May review. *(Revised — see the 2026-05 review.)*

> **Ops decision (2026-05-09 - #CloudAudit-5122)** Nadia: escalation-pressure ledger (final). Walk the anomaly rows in the same order they are written to flagged.jsonl, carrying state between consecutive rows; the carry starts at 0. For each row: gap_ms is the previous row's observed_ms minus this row's observed_ms, floored at 0 (the export order is observed_ms descending, so this is the elapsed distance between neighbours); carry_in = max(previous_carry_out - (gap_ms // 150), 0); escalation_pressure = chain_risk_score + ceil(carry_in / 3) — the carry credit is divided by three and ROUNDED UP, not floored, which is the point revised from #CloudAudit-4931 and left open by #CloudAudit-5044 (in integer arithmetic ceil(x/3) is -(-x // 3)); carry_out = min(carry_in + chain_risk_score - (chain_size // 2), 90) — note the chain-size debit and the 90 cap, both revising the earlier 100 cap and its absent debit. A row is escalation-critical when escalation_pressure >= 10. Only the carry credit rounds up; the gap decay and the chain-size debit are floored. This supersedes #CloudAudit-4931 and #CloudAudit-5044.

> **Ops decision (2026-05-09 - #CloudAudit-5123)** Nadia: escalation ledger reporting. critical_escalation_ids — alert_id values of the escalation-critical rows as strings, sorted lexicographically ascending (not in export order). critical_escalation_count — their number. max_escalation_pressure — the largest escalation_pressure over all anomaly rows, escalation-critical or not, and 0 when there are no anomaly rows. escalation_ledger_checksum — SHA-256 hex digest of one line per anomaly row in export order, each `alert_id|escalation_pressure|c|carry_out` where c is 1 for an escalation-critical row and 0 otherwise, lines joined by a single newline with no trailing newline, hashed over the UTF-8 encoding.
